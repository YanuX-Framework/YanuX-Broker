This is part of the [__YanuX Frameworl__](https://yanux-framework.github.io/). It is a server-side component that is responsible for aggregating and spreading the information that client application instances need to build a cohesive user experience.

## Documentation
This project is built using to [Feathers](https://feathersjs.com/) framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and many [other packages](package.json.

It exposes the following APIs:
- [__REST API__](https://yanux-framework.github.io/YanuX-Broker/)
    - Please note that this documentation was partially automatically generated. It's not exaustive and that it may be incomplete.
- The [__REST API__](https://yanux-framework.github.io/YanuX-Broker/) is "mirrored" by the [Feathers](https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/client.html) and [Socket.io](https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/client/socketio.html) API but these provide [realtime events](https://docs.feathersjs.com/api/events.html#service-events) that can be pushed by the server.

### TODO:
- Provide additional documentation.
